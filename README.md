## The Long Story
Prior to law school, I worked as a paralegal. Most of the firms I worked with had case management software. One firm in particular had Time Matters, and tasked me with making it work as efficiently as possible. While I could manipulate most of the screens, the main page for each case could only be manipulated by coders. I remember being frustrated that we had to outsource that part of the project to an outside company. 

Fast forward to choosing classes for my 2L fall semester. There it was- a class that might just give me the tools I desired to make those changes all those years ago. At the time, I had just started with a small firm in North Reading. While discussing the courses I would be taking in the fall, I mentioned this course. To my surprise, it turns out that a former law clerk took this same class not that long ago. I even took over the same law clerk email address at the firm! After getting his name from my boss, I found his Final Project biography. He built a form automation system to assist the firm. I found his email address and reached out to him about potentially building upon his work or to see if he had any other ideas. After exchanging [a few emails](https://github.com/showie56/CTL_Final_Project/blob/main/Emails%20with%20former%20student_Redacted.pdf), it didn't really seem feasible to build upon his project. So here I was, back at square one, searching for ideas.

With an unexpectedly difficult semester in full effect, my research into potential ideas to help my current firm led me to one conclusion- I was making it harder on myself by not joining onto a project that had a built-in support system.  After speaking with Professor Colarusso, I decided to join the Suffolk LITLab's Document Assembly Line project.
